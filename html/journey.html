                                Nicholas James Vujicic (Nick Vujicic) was born on 4 December 1982 to Boris Vujicic and Dushka Vujicic in Melbourne, Australia.

                                Nick Vujicic was born with a rare disorder, tetra-amelia syndrome (phocomelia) by which he lacked arms and legs.
                                
                                His parents didn’t expect their baby to be born without arms and legs but he had only two small deformed feet.
                                
                                An operation was performed to separate his toes, so that he can use them as fingers.
                                
                                After this operation, Nick Vujicic learned how to write and type on a computer with his fingers on his foot.
                                
                                He can also operate an electric chair and a mobile phone.

                                Nick Vujicic’s life without limbs was very difficult and he used to face many challenges since his childhood.

Even as he suffered severe physical disability, he was also subjected to mental and emotional torture by his school mates who made fun of his disability.

In his school days, Nick Vujicic was subjected to bullying.

He was disappointed with himself because he looked weird when compared to the other students and unlike his fellow students he couldn’t ride a bike or go to the soccer field.

No one befriended him and supported him in his class, so he was subjected to loneliness and hopelessness.

Nick Vujicic thought that his life is a complete waste and he will never be able to get married and will never be able to secure a job.

So, he thought that there is no purpose for him to stay alive.

And as a result, he got depressed.

                                These things broke Nick Vujicic from inside and he thought of committing suicide when he was just 8 years old.

At an age when a child tries to learn about the world, Nick Vujicic experienced severe despair and sadness.

Nick Vujicic was loved by his parents and siblings
The only thing which prevented him from committing suicide was the love he received from his parents and siblings.

Nick Vujicic was enlightened when he read the bible, in which there was a mention about Jesus helping a man who was born blind and he read that the man was born blind so that the works of god can be revealed through him.

So, he realised that the god has plans for everybody, if he had plans for the blind man, the god will have a plan for him too.

This cemented his belief in the god. 

Nick Vujicic was different from other children unlike other children, he was searching for the purpose of his life from a very small age and he started believing in himself and in the almighty.

                                Fortunately, during these times Nick Vujicic came across a newspaper article which described the achievements of a disabled person.

By knowing how a fellow disabled man has faced challenges and eventually overcame them, this story gave him the much needed confidence which completely changed his viewpoint towards his life.

And Nick Vujicic also realised that he can lead a normal life and can achieve something significant.

                                Arnold, an old janitor at his school was the first person who wanted Nick Vujicic to become a speaker.       

But Nick Vujicic opposed this thought as he believed that he knew nothing to speak about.        

But the janitor did not give up and he relentlessly persuaded Nick Vujicic to share his life story.

And he bugged him continuously for three months to speak but Nick Vujicic wouldn’t agree until one day when the janitor twisted his arm.

Nick Vujicic gave his first speech when he was 19.

And he never turned back in his life again.

Nick Vujicic eventually found that his purpose in his life is to motivate people and to inspire them to reach their full potential.

So, he became a motivational speaker.

He urges the people to find their passion in their lives.

                                This gave Nick Vujicic a new direction and purpose in life.

He decided to make his weakness his greatest strength.

So, Nick Vujicic decided to motivate people by telling them his real-life story and how he overcame the negative emotions.

                                Once, Nick Vujicic was giving a speech to 300 sophomore public high school students.

And after three minutes of his speech, half of the girls in the hall started crying and one girl in the room started to weep and she interrupted his speech and came to him and gave him a hug.

She cried on his shoulder and whispered in his ear that he was beautiful the way he was.

And these words transformed his life.

Nick Vujicic says that one must not lose his hope, as losing hope is worse than losing soul.
